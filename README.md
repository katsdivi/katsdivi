# Hi, I’m Divyam Kataria 👋

### Computer Science @ Arizona State University
**AI Systems Builder | Quant Finance Developer | Full-Stack Engineer**

I build intelligent, product-focused systems across **personal finance, quantitative modeling, and real-world data intelligence**. I care about shipping usable tools with strong engineering fundamentals: retrieval, latency, evaluation, privacy, and real users.

**Currently building:** **Contextual**, a local semantic search engine (Spotlight replacement) that makes your files and knowledge base actually searchable.
